# MongoDB / Mongoose webshop backend

An example of a backend for a webshop with MongoDB and Mongoose. Use this example as inspiration and reference. Note however that more tests should be written to fully cover the backend!

### Installing

Run `npm install` in the root directory.

### Running the app

The backend can be started with `npm start`. It will start listening and serve your requests.

### Running the tests

To run all tests use `npm test`. There are three kinds of tests:
- unit tests on the schemas
- integration tests on the endpoints
- system tests by walking through a 'user journey'
